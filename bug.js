This error occurs when using Expo CLI and occurs when building an Android app. The error message is cryptic and doesn't provide much information.  It usually manifests during the build process and is related to a mismatch or conflict in dependencies, or an issue with the Android build environment.  The error message itself often contains parts of the Gradle build output but lacks a clear, actionable pointer to the problem's source.
