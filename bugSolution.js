The solution to this issue usually involves systematic troubleshooting:

1. **Clean the project:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove any cached files that might be conflicting.
2. **Check the complete error log:** The full error log from the Expo CLI build process often contains hints about the root cause. Look for lines indicating specific errors, dependency conflicts, or missing resources.  
3. **Update dependencies:** Ensure that all dependencies in your `package.json` are up-to-date. Run `expo update` and then `npm install` or `yarn install` to update them.
4. **Verify Android environment setup:** Confirm that the Android SDK, NDK, and other required tools are correctly installed and configured. Check your Android Studio settings.
5. **Inspect `gradle.properties` and `android/app/build.gradle`:** Look for any configuration issues in these files that might be causing conflicts.  Common problems include incorrect dependency versions or conflicting settings.
6. **Exclude problematic dependencies:** If you suspect a particular dependency is the culprit, try excluding it temporarily to see if the build succeeds. This can help isolate the issue.
7. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** In Android Studio, try invalidating caches and restarting the IDE. This can resolve issues with cached build files.

**Example (Illustrative -  the specific problem will vary):**
Let's say a dependency conflict exists between two libraries. The solution might involve adjusting versions or using the `resolutionStrategy` within `android/build.gradle` to resolve the conflict.  (Note: This is not a guaranteed solution and the exact method will depend on the specific error.)

```gradle
// In android/app/build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.example:libraryA:1.0.0")
    implementation("com.example:libraryB:2.0.0")
}

// In android/build.gradle, to manage conflicts
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
            if (details.requested.group == 'com.example' && details.requested.name == 'libraryA') {
                details.useVersion("1.0.0") // Or a compatible version
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `com.example:libraryA` and `com.example:libraryB` with your actual dependency names.  The specific solution will depend on the details of the error.
