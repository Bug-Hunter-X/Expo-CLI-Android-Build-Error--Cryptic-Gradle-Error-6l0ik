# Expo CLI Android Build Error: Cryptic Gradle Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error encountered when building Android apps using Expo CLI. The error message is often unhelpful, making debugging challenging. This example showcases a potential scenario and its solution.

## Problem
The main issue is the lack of specific details in the error message during the Expo build process.  The error often points to a problem within the Gradle build system but fails to pinpoint the root cause. This makes it difficult to trace back to the exact dependency or configuration causing the problem. 

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining the complete error log, focusing on any dependency conflicts or environment inconsistencies.  Cleaning the project, updating dependencies, and ensuring the correct Android environment setup are essential steps.  In some cases, a specific dependency might need to be excluded or a configuration change within the `gradle.properties` or `android/app/build.gradle` files might resolve the issue.
